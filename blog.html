            <h2 id="kneuheader">Ukrainian universities teach you life rather degree</h2>
            <p id="kneutext">Alarm, the Bachelor-slowpoke is on the line.
                    <br>Yes, I have graduated from university and yes, I am not 16. Well, to be honest, university didn’t give me an incredible amount of knowledge, BUT it gave me life changing experience, made me open minded and, to some extent, fearless. It gave me absolutely MY people and I am extremely thankful for that.
                    <br>
                    <br>After conducting a couple or two lectures on opportunities for students I have realized that very few people know how to spend student years maximum productively. So that is why I am here and that is why I am writing this article.
                    <br>
                    <br>So read attentively and take all those points into account.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
                    <br><br>☝🏼practice networking. Meet new people, introduce them to your acquaintances and help all of them. Develop your relations with others and in one great moment you will notice how many opportunities these people can give you.
                    <br>✌🏼take part in cultural life of your university. My love for it is internal as it gave me the most. Take part in events, act, organize and so on! Don’t hesitate and do your best. You will find amazing people, new ideas, dreams and maybe even your life goal or destiny. It’s okay if you find you wishing to give up the specialization you study, then change it and start doing something absolutely new. Maybe you were born to be an actor, a manager or a plumber.
                    <br>✌🏼☝🏼don’t forget about opportunities. Every University has its own department which is responsible for study mobility. This is a perfect opportunity to study abroad for the whole term, receive new emotions and experience and find yourself to be hardly motivated. Another theme is Erasmus trainings and projects. There is nothing better, believe me. It gives you lifechanging knowledge, new stunning people at your side, who definitely change your life and unexpected experience which you will you on daily basis.
                    <br>✌🏼✌🏼apply for programs kind of Work&travel. In our country they are available only for students of 2nd or 3rd year so there is no time to hold back. You will regret that if you lose such opportunity.
                    <br>✋🏼 take internship into account. After university we have a vicious circle: at a job interview after graduation they say that you need experience but when you are student they say that we need graduated specialists. WHAAT? But don’t hurry to be upset as you have internships which help you to receive this necessary experience.
                    And also it acts as a good opportunity to receive a constant position in international company after the ending of your internship.
                    <br>✋🏼☝🏼Volunteering. If you don’t try you won’t know that this is not a waste of time. It is not when you for free, this is when people give you money in another interpretation such as experience, knowledge and a broad field for networking.
                    <br>✋🏼✌🏼travel a lot. Use your student discount (up to 40%) for transportation and visiting places. And ask everywhere if there is a discount for students because in most places they have it but they don’t usually promote it. Moreover we have enough time to travel only when we are students or retired so use this time wisely.
                    <br>✋🏼✌🏼☝🏼Develop yourself. It is just a reminder as people usually forget about it
                    <br>
                    <br>So as said “put it into your pipe and smoke it”❤️</span>

                <h2 id="treatheader">Loving yourself is a key</h2>
                <p id="treattext">Right now, at this moment and on this stage of life I feel pretty happy about where I am and what I have.
                        <br><br>But why is it so hard to start value what we own?
                        <br><br>We all too often run after better things but when we receive them we start to want more and so we don’t treat the thing we have obtained with an appropriate value.
                        If back to several years ago and refresh your wishes you will see that many of them came true. So why are we still not happy? You’ve got the phone you have wanted for long, you have that long hair which you were growing and you have graduated from the university you want to leave faster. There seems to be nothing to prevent your happiness but still you are not satisfied with the things you have. What’s wrong? The problem is in us.<span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1">
                        It’s hard to start value the things you have as the desire for better things is stronger. But as soon as you start appreciate your life, it appears to be a panacea from the state frustration which hinder your joyful wellbeing.
                        <br><br>So how to find this panacea?
                        <br>What about being thankful for at least three things every day? And right in a week you will see that life is not about negativity but lots of really valuable things you didn’t notice before.
                        <br><br>And what if you stop comparing yourself with others? We are all different and everyone has his own problems about which you could be unaware. Life has its balance so we receive something nice by paying something bad and vice versa. Someone also thinks that your life is a way better than his/her.
                        <br>Hm, and what about downsize your belongings? Try to buy worse phone or smaller apartment and you will see how good are the things you had previously. Maybe it will make you more attentive to the things you have.
                                Actually, we have a myriad of really valuable things but your (to be honest) unnecessary desires overshadow all their value.
                                Please, appreciate that after a hard day you have a hand to hold yours.
